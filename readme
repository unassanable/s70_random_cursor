**Project Title:** Random Cursor: Personalized Cursor Animation Extension  

**Project Overview**  
*Random Cursor* is a web extension designed to enhance user interaction by dynamically changing the cursor to a randomly animated design on every page refresh or navigation. This extension offers personalization features, including user account creation, saving favorite cursors, and organizing them into playlists. Users can upload custom animated cursors, browse a curated gallery, and sync their preferences across devices. Built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—the extension provides a seamless, cross-platform experience.  

**Key Features**  

1. **Dynamic Cursor Animations**  
   - A new animated cursor is applied every time the page refreshes or when navigating to a new page.  

2. **User Authentication**  
   - Secure sign-up and sign-in functionality using modern authentication protocols.  

3. **Favorites and Playlists**  
   - Save favorite cursors and organize them into personalized playlists for easy switching.  

4. **Custom Cursor Uploads**  
   - Users can upload custom animated cursors (e.g., `.cur`, `.gif`) for a unique experience.  

5. **Cross-Device Synchronization**  
   - Preferences, playlists, and saved cursors are synced across devices via the backend.  

6. **User Profile Management**  
   - A dedicated profile page for managing playlists, preferences, and account settings.  

7. **Cursor Gallery**  
   - A pre-built collection of animated cursors for users to explore, select, and add to their playlists.  

**Tech Stack**  

1. **Frontend**  
   - **React:** Development of responsive UI components for the sign-up/sign-in pages, Cursor Gallery, and profile management.  
   - **CSS/SCSS:** Design and styling for a polished and adaptive user interface.  
   - **Axios:** Facilitate HTTP requests to the backend.  
   - **Browser Extension APIs:** Enable cursor animation functionality across web pages.  

2. **Backend**  
   - **Node.js:** Server-side logic for handling requests and functionality.  
   - **Express.js:** RESTful APIs for user authentication and cursor data management.  
   - **MongoDB:** Flexible NoSQL database for storing user data, favorites, and playlists.  
   - **Mongoose:** Simplifies MongoDB schema definitions and queries.  
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Ensure secure, token-based user authentication.  

3. **Authentication and Data Management**  
   - **Passport.js:** Secure user authentication.  
   - **JWT:** Stateless authentication and secure data retrieval.  

**Why This Project?**

   - **Browser Extension Development:** Learn to use browser extension APIs to interact with web pages and enhance user experiences.  
   - **Authentication and Security:** Implement secure user authentication with JWT and Passport.js.  
   - **Real-Time Data Syncing:** Explore methods to manage and sync user preferences across devices using MongoDB.  
   - **Cloud Data Management:** Understand how cloud-based systems store and retrieve user-specific data.  

3. **Full-Stack Development**  
   - This project integrates frontend and backend technologies, offering a comprehensive understanding of developing and managing web applications.  

4. **Browser API Integration**  
   - Develop an extension that modifies web page interactions and integrates seamlessly with browser functionality.  

**Value of the Project**  
*Random Cursor* combines entertainment and utility, creating a fun and personalized web browsing experience. For developers, it offers a unique opportunity to master the MERN stack, browser extension APIs, user authentication, and cloud data management. The skills acquired through this project can be applied to a wide range of web applications, from simple extensions to complex full-stack solutions.
